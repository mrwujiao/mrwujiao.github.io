#### Profile

# **Viet Cuong Truong**

I started my career as graphic designer for printed media, quickly followed by designs for brands and visual identities. After I realised that my main passion was in digital design, I took the transition to focus my expertise to become a full stack digital designer. I have gathered solid understandings for design and development and becomed very well versed in everything digital design. I love exploring playful and beautiful designs that pushes bounderies — always with the user’s perspective in mind.

Finally, I'm an avid runner, biker, hiker and a father.
